# Project Overview: React Text Highlighter App (PoC)

This project is a React application designed to showcase a text highlighting feature. Users can interact with the text content, selecting portions of text to highlight, and even remove the highlights with a click. The implementation includes touch support for mobile devices, allowing users to highlight text seamlessly across various platforms.

The base project was created using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Key Features

- Text highlighting using spans.
- Seamless removal of highlights.
- Mobile-friendly touch support.
- Clean and organized React component structure.

Feel free to explore the code and integrate this text highlighting functionality into your own React projects!

## Technologies and Packages Utilized

The React Text Highlighter App utilizes the following technologies and packages:

- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for styling.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime used for building server-side applications.
- **npm (Node Package Manager):** Used for managing project dependencies.

## Installation Guide

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and npm**: Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bueno/react-text-marking-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd react-text-marking-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

**In the project directory, you can use the scripts below:**

1. **Running the project**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   It runs the app in the development mode.\
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

   The page will reload when you make changes.\
   You may also see any lint errors in the console.

2. **Launching the test runner**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
    See in the **create-react-app** the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

3. **Building the app for production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
    It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

   The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
    Your app is ready to be deployed!

   See in the **create-react-app** the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

4. **Removing the single build dependency from your project**

   ```bash
   npm run eject
   ```

   **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

   If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

   Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

   You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
